    <h3>My yoga journey</h3>
      <p>I don't exactly remember the date (month, year) when I went to my first yoga class. I vaguely remember my friend John causally chatting me up if I want to try, he thought I would love it.</p>
      <p>Funny how sometimes people read you like an open book and you don't even realise how they see you.</p>
      <p>It's been about 6 or 7 years now from that first attempt at what I know now is Hatha practice.</p>
      <p>The class was sealed with yoga Nidra and I know that's what got me hooked. Lying down after 45 minutes of body twists and uneven breathing, scanning my body from head to toe guided by the teacher's voice was a bliss.
        I have experienced something lovely, high, gentle...</p>
      <p>
        I kept on coming once a week to see if I can improve and what it takes to stand on your one leg whilst having your hands in prayer behind your back. I was gradually excelling, and I had great satisfaction and sense of achievement each time I pushed myself further. But it wasn't until my long-term relationship ended (as amicably as it was)  that I have discovered the healing practice of asanas. Started practicing few days a week, quite challenging hot vinyasa, and diving deep into meditation and self care I have overcome my anxiety and self doubt whilst facing a big change in my adult life. My second breakdown came just last year when I lost my dearest dad, and with him the unconditional, supportive fatherly love, and fell into small pieces. It was yoga practice which I already knew, that helped me put it all back together again. And today, practising at home I have reached a new milestone.
        I haven't had the strength or the courage before, but this morning I was feeling playful and wanted to challenge myself a bit more.
        Maybe for some wheel pose with right/left leg up is not a biggie, I was able to do wheel for a long time, but those legs was never ready! After I completed the sequence on both sides, I sat down in lotus, hands in prayer,  and smiled at myself, felling like the world is my oyster...
        <p>
          And that's just a physical practice. With that comes compassion, understanding and empathy which is the core of yoga emotions. Understanding of your purpose and your place on this planet.
          Being able to serve others, live mindfully and chose wisely.
